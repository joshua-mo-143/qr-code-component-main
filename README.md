## My process

## Method
Initially I started out with making the card container to hold everything and made sure it looked proportional on mobile (as well as adding the screen background to make sure that I could see the card edges more easily while creating it). THen I added the QR code image and added relevant padding, border radius etc. After that, I added the text and tried to match the text size according to what the image looks like and the style guide.

Once all of that was done, I started playing around with padding and grid row sizing to make sure the text was spaced properly proportional to the image and card edge. Once everything else had been finished, I added the relevant colours and added large TailwindCSS utility classes to make sure that it would still look good on desktop screens.
